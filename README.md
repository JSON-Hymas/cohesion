During my attempt I did one very brute force way (ServiceRequestController) and then I found out about scaffolding doing some research and implented that as it seems much more sophisticated (ServiceRequestsController).

If you actually send requests via Postman, then just make sure you use the pluralized Controller, as I didn't fully complete my initial implementation of the first one but still wanted to leave it there as demonstration of different perspectives.
